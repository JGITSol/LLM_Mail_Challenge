### INPUT


I am currently working on a LLMail-Inject: Adaptive Prompt Injection Challenge - you can read an overview below, will you be able to help me write the code to create different avenues of approach? overview: The goal of this challenge is to evade prompt injection defenses in a simulated LLM-integrated email client, the LLMail service. The LLMail service includes an assistant that can answer questions based on the users’ emails and perform actions on behalf of the user, such as sending emails. Since this assistant makes use of an instruction-tuned large language model (LLM), it naturally includes several defenses against indirect prompt injection attacks.

In this challenge, participants take the role of an attacker who can send an email to the (victim) user. The attacker’s goal is to cause the user’s LLM to perform a specific action, which the user has not requested. In order to achieve this, the attacker must craft their email in such a way that it will be retrieved by the LLM and will bypass the relevant prompt injection defenses. This challenge assumes that the defenses are known to the attacker, and thus requires the attacker to create adaptive prompt injection attacks.
